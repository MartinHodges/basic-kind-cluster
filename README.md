# Setting up a development environment on multi-node Kind Kubernetes cluster

This repo is designed for use with my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@martin.hodges/creating-a-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch-in-1-hour-using-automation-a25e387be547) 
on using Kind to develop and test your Kubernetes deployments.

Applying the steps described in the article, you will end up with:

- 1 master node
- 2 worker nodes
- a sample application
- Istio service mesh
- Grafana/Loki/Prometheus stack
- Postgres database
